Algorithm Steps:

1. Initialize all servos to a standing position.    (Both legs straight, body balanced vertically, feet flat.)

2. Shift the body weight slightly to the right leg. (Move the center of mass above the right leg to free the left leg.)

3. Lift the left leg by bending the left hip and knee servos.

4. Move the left leg forward using the hip servo.

5. Lower the left leg back to the ground            (place the foot flat).

6. Shift the body weight to the left leg.           (Now the center of mass is above the left leg.)

7. Lift the right leg by bending the right hip and knee servos.

8. Move the right leg forward using the hip servo.

9. Lower the right leg back to the ground.

10. Repeat steps 2â€“9 for continuous walking.
